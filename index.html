      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Details here...</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was raised in Cooper City FL and I grew up in Coconut Grove FL</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy flying drones and fishing</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I wanted to bein IT most of my life in Networking and cyber security. But because I am more of a visual person I now want to be a front end developer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Now I am living in Hobe Sound Florida</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After moving back to Florida and spending 5 years burring 5 family members the Corona Virus hit. At the beginning of the pandemic, when everyone was in lockdown, I was banned from Facebook for a reason I was never given. This not only took away access to all of my friends as I had spent the previous 10 years living out of state, but whenever I try to find a restaurant, something to do, or anything on the web run by a business that can not afford a website and SEO for ranking, I am blocked. This “ban” was also carried over to Etsy and even CraigsList preventing me from seeking employment. I have decided to learn to become a web developer and I intend on building a team to spearhead a new social media website designed to compete with and fucking destroy FaceBook. I want to create a social media “utility” that censors no one, operates without any collection or selling of data and makes Mark Zuckerberg go bankrupt.</p>
